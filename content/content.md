This page `is a` work `in progress oh` no!`!! Don't look!!!!`

`Blackout poetry, or erasure poetry,` is a `form of found poetry or found` object `art` created `by erasing words from an existing text in prose or verse and framing the result` on the page `as a poem.[1] The results can be allowed to stand in situ` or `they can be arranged into lines or stanzas.`

`Writers and visual artists have adopted this form both to achieve a ra`n`ge of c`o`gnitive or symbolic effects and to focus on the social or political meanings of erasure. Blackout poetry is a way to give an existing piece of writing a new set of meanings, questions, or suggestions. It lessens the trace of authorship but also draws attention to the original text`.`
