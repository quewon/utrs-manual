**Camera movement speed** and **camera rotation speed** can be configured in the [Level Settings menu]().

## Placing objects

First, choose an object preset from the [Object Preset menu]().

```note-blue
You can access the [Object Preset menu]() by clicking on an empty slot in the [Object tray](), or by hovering over a non-empty slot and clicking on the pencil icon ![](/media/icons/pencil.svg#icon).
```

First, load your [object tray]() with the object that you'd like to place.

Snapping can be configured in the Level Settings

### Positioning, scaling, and rotating objects

### Grid snapping

Z grid slider bottom left

Toggle Grid Snapping button in toolbar

Grid color, size, and toggle in level settings

---

### Selecting objects

Pick (click)

Multiselect (click drag / shift click)

---

### Deleting objects

## Creating a custom structure

You can create custom structures by first selecting 1 or more objects and then clicking on the **Create Custom Structure** ![Create Custom Structure icon](/media/icons/CreateCustomStructure.svg#icon) button in the [toolbar]().

You can manage your custom structures by navigating to [Project menu]() > **Resources** > **Structures**.

[Table of contents]

---

### Variable parameters

When creating a custom structure, you can choose to add a variable parameter. This will enable a right-click action when clicking on your structure from the [object tray](), which will allow you to set the value of the designated variable for every object within the structure.

```note-blue
**Why can't I find the variable I want?**
Some objects, such as Start Zone or Secret, have limited or no parameterable variables. If you can't find the variable you're looking for, chances are the object(s) you're using doesn't support it.
```

<!-- The tilde (~) above prevents this header from being visible on the page. I did this here because I want to use an H4 header, but I don't want it to be a subsection of "Variable parameters". -->

## Objects

Objects are the basic building block of any level.

### Shapes

Shapes are basic geometric objects. Don't be fooled by their simplicity, as they have a wide variety of uses ranging from blocking out levels to building [custom structures]().

| Pyramid | Shape, Material, Color | Material |
| Corner Out | Shape, Material, Color | Material |
